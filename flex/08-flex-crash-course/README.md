# Flexbox Crash Course

In this bonus (suggested content), Brad Traversy at Traversy Media gave an excellent hands-on crash course on Flexbox. It starts with covering all the basic concepts and then launches straight into building a "real-world" type example.

I personally felt this was the best course so far on Flexbox as it helped me tremendously to better understand how Flexbox works, and to be walked step-by-step through the creation of a responsive webpage. I'd highly recommend to anyone still struggling (like me) after the initial Odin Project lessons. 5 Stars
