# CSS Grid Crash Course

In this bonus (suggested content), Brad Traversy at Traversy Media gave an excellent hands-on crash course on CSS Grid. It starts with covering all the basic concepts and then launches straight into building a "real-world" type example, based on a project by Frontend Mentor.

I personally felt this was the best course so far on CSS Grid as it helped me tremendously to better understand how Grid works, and to be walked step-by-step through the creation of a responsive webpage. I'd highly recommend to anyone still struggling (like me) after the initial Odin Project lessons. 5 Stars
